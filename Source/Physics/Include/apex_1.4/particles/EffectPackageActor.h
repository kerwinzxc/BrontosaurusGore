\brief An EffectPackageActor represents an instantiation of a collection of related particle actors
The EffectPackage system allows for multiple related particle actors to be instantiated as a single
unit with a single root pose transform.  This can be one or more emitters as well as associated
field samplers, heat sources, etc.  This single instantiation can be subject to level of detail culling
and otherwise manipulated as a single unit.

EffectPackages are authored using the 'ParticleEffectTool' which allows the developer to rapidly
prototype a combined 'particle effect'.  This is a PhysX 3.x only feature.
