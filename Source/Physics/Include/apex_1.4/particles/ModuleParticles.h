/**
\brief Defines the API for the Particles Module

The particles module combines the features of a number of particle related APEX modules
into one location; with the exception of APEX turbulence.  It also provides support for
the EffectPackage actor and asset as well as integration with the ParticleEffectAuthoring
tool.

Loading the APEX Particles module will now automatically cause the following related modules
to be instantiated.

APEX_Emitter
APEX_BasicIOS
APEX_IOFX
APEX_FieldSampler
APEX_BasicIOS
APEX_ParticleIOS
APEX_ForceField

These modules are no longer loaded as separate DLLs and instantiated individually like they were
prior to APEX 1.3.  Instead simply loading the APEX_Particles DLL or calling 'instantiateModuleParticles'
will cause the other particle related modules to be loaded.

The rationale for making this change was to simplify the startup/shutdown sequence for applications
using APEX particle related effects.  It also dramatically simplifies the distribution process for
developers as they now only have to deal with a single DLL rather than as many as 8 which were
required before.

The turbulence module was not folded into the unified APEX_Particles module at this time since
the source code for it is not yet made available to licensees.

It is important to note that since the APEX_Particles module does not load the Turbulence module,
the application *must* load the Turbulence module first so that it will already be registered.
